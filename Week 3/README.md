## Week 3 Write-Up
Week 3 provided an introduction of malware defense presented by Craig Schmugar a security speicalist at McAfee. Material for the week consisted of malware first contact, detection, defensive tactics dependent on attack vector, signature analysis, and attack flows. Included in the material was a lab which utilized Yara which itself provides a rule-based approach to create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns. We also were introduced to the Cuckoo malware analysis tool which is used to create a sandbox for executing malicious files to study and understand malware. Following I will discuss in detail the material that was covered in week 3.

General malware behavior is depicted in the diagram seen below:
